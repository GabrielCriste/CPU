# Installation

As Storch is still in an early stage of development, there are no published artifacts available yet. So for the time being, you'll have to
build it from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sbrunk/storch
cd storch
sbt publishLocal
```

Then, add Storch as a dependency to your project:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="sbt" label="sbt" default>

```scala
libraryDependencies += Seq(
  "dev.storch" % "storch:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="scala-cli" label="Scala-CLI">

```scala
//> using scala "3"
//> using repository "sonatype:snapshots"
//> using lib "dev.storch::storch:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Adding the native PyTorch libraries

To use Storch, we also need to depend on the native PyTorch libraries (LibTorch),
which are provided by the [JavaCPP](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp) project, as part of their autogenerated Java bindings.
There are multiple ways to add the native libraries.

:::note

Why doesn't Storch just depend on the native PyTorch libraries itself?

Because these are native C++ libraries, which are different for each operating system and architecture.
Furthermore, there are variants for CPU and GPUs which are incompatible with each other.
We don't want to force users on Storch to use one variant over another, so you'll have to add the native dependency yourself.

### Via PyTorch platform

The easiest and most portable way to depend on the native library is via the PyTorch platform dependency:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="sbt" label="sbt" default>

```scala
resolvers += "Sonatype OSS Snapshots" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"
libraryDependencies += Seq(
  "dev.storch" % "storch:@VERSION@",
  "org.bytedeco" % "pytorch-platform" % "1.13.1-@JAVACPP_VERSION@"
)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="scala-cli" label="Scala-CLI">

```scala
//> using repository "sonatype:snapshots"
//> using lib "dev.storch::storch:@VERSION@"
//> using lib "org.bytedeco:pytorch-platform:1.13.1-@JAVACPP_VERSION@"
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

There is one downside to this approach. Because `pytorch-platform` depends on the native libraries for all supported
platforms, it will download and cache **all** these libraries, no matter on which platform you actually are.

One way to avoid the overhead, is to explicitly depend on the native libraries for **your** platform instead of using
`pytorch-platform`.

### Via classifier

This can be done by providing dependency classifiers specifically for your platform.
Currently supported are `linux-x86_64`, `macosx-x86_64` and `windows-x86_64`.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="sbt" label="sbt" default>

```scala
resolvers += "Sonatype OSS Snapshots" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"
libraryDependencies += Seq(
  "dev.storch" % "storch:@VERSION@",
  "org.bytedeco" % "pytorch" % "1.13.1-@JAVACPP_VERSION@",
  "org.bytedeco" % "pytorch" % "1.13.1-@JAVACPP_VERSION@" classifier "linux-x86_64"
)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="scala-cli" label="Scala-CLI">

```scala
//> using repository "sonatype:snapshots"
//> using lib "dev.storch::storch:@VERSION@"
//> using lib "org.bytedeco:openblas:0.3.21-@JAVACPP_VERSION@,classifier=linux-x86_64"
//> using lib "org.bytedeco:pytorch:1.13.1-@JAVACPP_VERSION@,classifier=linux-x86_64"
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now we're only downloading the native libraries for a single platform. The downside though is that the build is not portable anymore.
Fortunately for sbt and Gradle, there's a solution available as a build plugin.

### Automatically detect your platform

The [SBT-JavaCPP](https://github.com/bytedeco/sbt-javacpp) will automatically detect the current platform and set the right classifier.

In your `project/plugins.sbt`:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("org.bytedeco" % "sbt-javacpp" % "1.17")
```

`build.sbt`:
```scala
resolvers += "Sonatype OSS Snapshots" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"
libraryDependencies += Seq(
  "dev.storch" % "storch:@VERSION@"
)
javaCppPresetLibs ++= Seq("pytorch" -> "1.13.1")
fork := true

```

If you're using, you can use the [Gradle JavaCPP](https://github.com/bytedeco/gradle-javacpp] plugin to do the same.
